The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. And here's an app that can help you can track your work. Here are the basic steps:
Decide on the task to be done.
Set a timer for 25 minutes (a "Pomodoro").
Focus on the task until the timer rings.
Take a 5-minute break.
After every four Pomodoros, take a longer 20 minute break
